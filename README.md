Photo Sphere Proof of Concept for [ShareBy](https://share.storycloud.com)'s Image Viewer. It detects whether an image
has GPano data and indicates that the image can be shown in 3d. The detection requires no third-party libs and
can be integrated right-in to the current image viewer. If the user desires, we will load mistic100's
[Photo-Sphere-Viewer](https://github.com/mistic100/Photo-Sphere-Viewer) to do the heavy-lifting.

Give it a go [here](http://ccamarat.github.io/photosphere-poc/).

## What is a Photo Sphere?
From the [Google Maps website](http://www.google.com/maps/about/contribute/photosphere/):
> Normal photos show just a single viewpoint while photo spheres welcome others to freely look up,
> down, and all around to explore the entire scene.
